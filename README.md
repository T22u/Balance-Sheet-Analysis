In this documentation, we are going to discuss brief knowledge about
Balance Sheet Analysis and learn the whole procedure to analyse any
company balance sheet into a website , and talk about how we create a
balance sheet analysis website using django.
Balance sheet analysis is defined as an analysis of the assets,liabilities and
equity of a company. This analysis is conducted generally at annual basis.
The process of balance sheet analysis is used for deriving actual figures
about the revenue, assets and liabilities of the company. The balance sheet
analysis is helpful for the investors, investment bankers, share brokers, and
financial institution, for verifying the profitability of investment for a specific
company.

level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean,
pragmatic design. Django is a collection of Python libs allowing you to quickly
and efficiently create a quality Web application, and is suitable for both
frontend and backend.Django helps developers to avoid many common
security mistakes like SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking.
